h1. Lift In Action

The group of code is to accompany the Lift in Action book authored by Timothy Perrett and being published on Manning. 

The code in this repo uses a multi-project SBT build.

h1. Usage

Load up SBT in the normal way:
<pre><code>timperrett$ sbt</code></pre>

Take a look at the modules in this project
<pre><code>> projects
    four 1.0
    two 1.0
    three 1.0
    lift-in-action 1.0
</code></pre>

Then select a particular module we want to interact with:
<pre><code>> project four
Set current project to four 1.0
</code></pre>

Then you need to update the dependencies
<pre><code>> update</code></pre>

Then we can run actions on that module like normal:
<pre><code>> jetty</code></pre>
